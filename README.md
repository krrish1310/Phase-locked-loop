## 1. What *is* a PLL?

A **Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)** is an electronic control system that continuously compares the phase of its output signal against a reference input signal and **locks** the output phase (and therefore frequency) to that reference. If the reference is frequency-stable, the PLL inherits that stability.

> **Key idea:** A feedback loop actively minimizes phase error, ensuring the output tracks the reference even in the presence of noise or drift.

## 3. Core Components

| Component | Role | Design Notes |
|-----------|------|--------------|
| **Phase Detector (Comparator)** | Measures phase difference (Δφ) between reference and feedback. | Two broad classes: Type I (analog/digital; XOR, mixers) and Type II (digital; flip-flop + charge pump). |
| **Loop Filter** | Converts phase-error voltage (V/ rad) to a smooth control voltage (V/ Hz) for the VCO; suppresses ripple; ensures stability. | Usually ≥2nd-order low-pass; design trades off lock time vs. noise. |
| **VCO** | Generates the output signal; frequency varies with control voltage. | LC tank with varactor diodes is common; ring oscillators or crystal-based designs also appear. |
| **Feedback Path** | Scales the output frequency before returning it to the phase detector. | Integer or fractional dividers, prescalers, postscalers for flexibility. |

## 4. Phase Detector Types

| Type | Implementation | Phase Range | Pros | Cons |
|------|---------------|-------------|------|------|
| **Type I** | Digital XOR + RC filter (for square waves) or analog mixers (for sinusoids) | ±90° – ±180° (method dependent) | Simple; low component count. | High-frequency ripple; limited linear range. |
| **Type II** | Flip-flop latch + charge pump | ±180° | Ripple-free DC output; wide capture range. | Purely digital; needs charge-pump design. |

## 5. Design & Stability Tips

1. **Start with specs:** Required output frequency range, reference source quality, allowable jitter.
2. **Choose loop bandwidth** carefully — balance lock-in speed against noise suppression.
3. **Order matters:** A 2nd-order (or higher) loop filter is typically needed for Type II detectors to guarantee stability.
4. **Simulate early:** Use tools like LTspice, MATLAB, or Python-based control libraries to model open- and closed-loop response.
5. **Mind the dividers:** Fractional-N feedback lets you hit fine frequency steps but introduces quantization noise that must be shaped or filtered.

## 6. Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/pll-fundamentals.git
   cd pll-fundamentals
````

2. **Simulate**

   * **Analog path:** Open `ltspice/` examples and run transient + AC analyses.
   * **Digital path:** Try the `verilog/` phase-detector models under a free simulator like Icarus Verilog or Verilator.

3. **Explore**

   * Tweak component values in `loop_filter.asc`.
   * Compare Type I vs. Type II detector performance in noise tests.
   * Add a fractional divider block and observe spurs.
